            <h4><em>Discover by Curiosity, Not Algorithms</em></h4>
            <p>
                Radii is built for explorers — the ones who wander without a destination, follow instinct over ratings, and find beauty in the in-between places.
We believe discovery should feel personal again.
            </p>
            <h4><em>Why We Built Radii</em></h4>
            <p>
                Most apps tell you where to go based on what everyone else likes. Radii flips that idea.
We want to make exploration spontaneous — led by curiosity, not crowds. With Radii, every place becomes a story waiting to be uncovered.
            </p>
            <h4><em>Our Vision</em></h4>
            <p>
                We imagine a world where maps feel alive — where exploration isn’t about the shortest route, but the most meaningful one.
Radii connects people to places in deeper, more authentic ways.
            </p>
            <h4><em>Join the Journey</em></h4>
            <p>
                Every journey begins with a spark of curiosity.
Radii helps you follow it — one discovery at a time.
